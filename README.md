**Objective:**

-Predict loan approval status based on customer data using machine learning.


**Dataset:**

train.csv: Used for training.
test.csv: Used for testing.
Total features: 12 (including target variable).

**Steps:**

**Data Preprocessing:**

-Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
-Performed data cleaning and checked for outliers.


**EDA:**

-Visualized key insights using plots.
-Analyzed feature relationships with correlation, t-tests, and p-values.


**Feature Engineering:**

-Applied One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
-Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.


**Modeling:**

-Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
-Achieved 84% accuracy using XGBoost and Random Forest.


**Outcome:**

-Predicted loan approval on the test dataset with high accuracy using XGBoost.
